<h1>Certified Programming with Dependent Types</h1>
<h2><a href="http://adam.chlipala.net/">Adam Chlipala</a></h2>

<div class="summary">
<p>This is the web site for an in-progress textbook about practical engineering with <a href="http://coq.inria.fr/">the Coq proof assistant</a>.  The focus is on building programs with proofs of correctness, using dependent types and scripted proof automation.</p>

<p>I'm following an unusual philosophy in this book, so it may be of interest even to long-time Coq users.  At the same time, I hope that it provides an easier introduction for newcomers, since short and automated proofs are the starting point, rather than an advanced topic.</p>

<p>Interested in beta testing this book in a course you're teaching?  Please <a href="mailto:adamc@csail.mit.edu">drop me a line</a>!</p>

<p>A traditional hardcopy version will appear from <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/">MIT Press</a> Real Soon Now<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/R/Real-Soon-Now.html">*</a>.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Updated on November 16, 2009 with a version retargeted to Coq 8.2pl1, then again on January 14, 2011 to support Coq 8.3, and then again on March 29, 2012 to support Coq 8.4 beta.  On August 25, 2011, I started passes through all chapters, with an eye toward getting ready both for <a href="http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa11/6.892/">my fall class</a> and publication by MIT Press.  I added bibliographic references and index entries, along with the usual tweaks and improvements.  In late Summer 2012, the mode switched to final proofreading by others.</p>

<p>The current version is effectively a beta release.  It is intended to be consistent, self-contained, and useful, both for individual study and for introductory theorem-proving classes aimed at students with ML or Haskell experience and with basic familiarity with programming language theory.</p>

<p>The main omissions have to do with some supporting resources that I didn't get around to implementing when I used this book for a course.  Some suggested exercises are present (now only in a supplementary file), but only at points where I was looking to assign an exercise in the course.  Some chapters are lacking the annotations used to build reduced versions of their source code, where some definitions and proofs have been elided; the course instructor can step through such a file, guiding class participants in filling in the omitted code.</p>

<p>Previous versions included a final Part on programming language semantics in particular.  I have decided to separate that part out.  I plan to put it up as a supplementary resource eventually; for now it is simply removed.  (It remains present in the <a href="repo">Mercurial</a> history.)</p>
